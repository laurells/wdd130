            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>Our vision is to democratize community banking.
             Over centuries, rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs) have been used by demographics with a strong social fabric wgere groups come together to save, borrow and lend money to each other. We believe that this is a strong institution where the credit risk lies with the user and evidently, individual users are quite good at assessing the credit risks of their peers. 
            Contribution is formed with the vision to use technology to put the power of banking into the hands of trusted communities around the globe.</p>
