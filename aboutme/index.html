    <h2>Echichinwo, Laurels O.</h2>
    <p>My name is Laurels Echichinwo. I am from Rivers State, Nigeria. I served a mission in the Nigeria Lagos mission. I hope to earn a degree in Applied technology, am on my way to earning my first certificate in web & computer programming. I am also on a carrer path to earning a certificate in cybersecurity with CISCO academy.</p> 
    <p>I am an openminded person and love to learn new things. I love playing the piano. I love playing chess, table tennis and soccer. I'm trying to be good at making friends</p> 
    <p>I love BYUI because of how easy they make learning to be. Where I am from you have to compulsorily take a huge number of credit for the space of three months but with BYUI anyone can study and still be able to work at the same time. The school also encourages friendshipping and creating of connections between students as groups are organized to work on projects together regardless of race. I also love the way spirituality is embedded in education, this helps prepare students to recieve light, to function properly in the world's work. There is a sense of realization that we cannot do anything without involving the Lord.</p>
    <p>I love to design and I hope to be really good at this Art(Web design). I understand the advantages of learning web design. I can work from home, I can organize an institute here in Nigeria to enlighten and train students on web design which could be a personal business for me.</p>
    <p>I am member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I have been a member all my life because my both parents were member before I was given birth to. I love the church and everything about it, from the organization to the teachings I love everything. I love an admonition given by King benjamin to his people in the account of Mosiah 2:40-41, he said '...consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are bblessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven...remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.'</p>
