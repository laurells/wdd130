        Contribution is a rotating savings and credit association. Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs) are financial instruments in which the members are a trusted social network that includes friends, relatives, family, neighbours, and colleagues. The members agree to contribute an equal amount of money, typically on a monthly basis for a defined period. At the end of each cycle, a different member picks up the lump sum. ROSCA is a global phenomenon, and these informal microfinance groups have been documented around the developing world by different names. In India and Pakistan, itâ€™s called committee or chit fund, Susus in Southern Africa and the Caribbean, Ekub in Ethiopia, Seettuva in Sri Lanka, Tanomoshi-ko or Mujin in pre-1945 Japan, Tontines in West Africa, Arisan in Indonesia, Wichin Gye in Korea, Xitique in Mozambique and Djanggis in Cameroon, and likelembas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We call it CONTRIBUTION.

      <h1>About Contribution</h1>
      <p>
        Contribution wants to make saving, investing and borrowing money easy. We know that saving within a group is more effective that saving alone and that is why we have come up with this Idea. The goal is to create a network of saving pools that all may move forward together. 
      </p>
      <p>If we have an option to get money where we make more returns than a fixed deposit would we not be interested? The simplest way for anyone today is to be able to do this is on a web platform and on the move! So, Contribution is creating a website that enables people to form closed and highly trusted clubs within which they can Save, Invest and borrow money more efficiently!</p>
      <p>The concept of The Contribution concept is well-known and practised all over the world. But how exactly does it work?
        In a CONTRIBUTION, members contribute their money into a common fund. Usually, cONTRIBUTIONS are structured around monthly contribution. A member takes the money collected as a lump sum at the beginning of each cycle. This cycle continues for as long as the group exists.
        CONTRIBUTION operate by either:
        Giving the total money to the individual who is in need. One can receive the pot just once.
        Conducting a lottery. Those members who already received their payouts are excluded from the lottery.
        Bidding. The members who want the money bid to take the amount home.</p>
      <P>Advantages of CONTRIBUTION
        It has a clear beginning and end.
        There is no need to store the funds as money goes from one member's account to another's.
        It is a great saving instrument in rural areas where formal savings institutions are absent.
        There are a wide variety of CONTRIBUTIONS - market, religious, office, ethnic, or neighbourhood.
        There is transparency due to group regulation.
        It is an efficient business model. Money is put in the 'pot'/'pool', the meeting/auction occurs, and the money is distributed.
        It can be tailored to the income of the group.
        The savings of many are collected to form a lump sum, which one person can use it to pay school fees buy household durables, home repairs, cover unplanned expenses and medical emergencies.
        CONTRIBUTION enables people to reach their goals faster while improving their financial well-being. This has just begun its journey and is all set to gain consumer attention and be known as an effective saving and credit solution. Many people across the world might be unaware of this now, but very soon, things are going to change.
